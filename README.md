PawSearch library for search algorithms.

Introduction--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This library is implemented to demonstrate different search algorithms used in artificial intelligence based
systems. A set of informed, uninformed and local searching algorithms are implemented in this library.
This software is distributed under MIT free-software license.

What is in this library?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implemented algorithms:
* Uninformed Search Algorithms
    * Breadth First Search
    * Depth First Search
    * Depth Limited Search
    * Iterative Deepening Search
    * Uniform Cost Search
    * Bidirectional Search
    * Dijkstra Algorithms
* Informed Search Algorithms
    * Greedy Best First Search
    * A Star Search
* Local Search Algorithms
    * Hill Climbing Search
    * Local Beam Search

How to use the library?---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Specify Nodes of the graph (name of the node, neighbors, and the edge costs to each neighbor)
2. Create the graph dictionary
3. Specify heuristic values (If informed or local searches should be used)
4. Create the search algorithm object
5. Call the Search function in that object
6. Call getPath or getTraversal functions if a path was found.

Please run the "demo.py" file in "Demo" directory to familiarize with the PawSearch library and how to use it.
Library functions are fully commented. Information regarding how to use the functions are mentioned.
